# Keybindings

Micro has a plethora of hotkeys that make it easy and powerful to use and all
hotkeys are fully customizable to your liking.
Custom keybindings are stored internally in micro if changed with the `>bind` command or
you can also be added in the file `~/.config/micro/bindings.json` as discussed below.
For a list of the default keybindings in the json format used by micro, please see
the end of this file. For a more user-friendly list with explanations of what the default
hotkeys are and what they do, please see `>help defaultkeys`

If `~/.config/micro/bindings.json` does not exist, you can simply create it.
Micro will know what to do with it.

You can use the alt keys + arrows to move word by word.
Ctrl left and right move the cursor to the start and end of the line, and
ctrl up and down move the cursor the start and end of the buffer.

You can hold shift with all of these movement actions to select while moving.

# Rebinding keys

The bindings may be rebound using the `~/.config/micro/bindings.json`
file. Each key is bound to an action.

For example, to bind `Ctrl-y` to undo and `Ctrl-z` to redo, you could put the
following in the `bindings.json` file.

```json
{
	"CtrlY": "Undo",
	"CtrlZ": "Redo"
}
```

In addition to editing your `~/.config/micro/bindings.json`, you can run
`>bind <keycombo> <action>` For a list of bindable actions, see below.

You can also chain commands when rebinding. For example, if you want Alt-s to save
and quit you can bind it like so:

```json
{
    "Alt-s": "Save,Quit"
}
```

# Unbinding keys

It is also possible to disable any of the default key bindings by use of the 
`UnbindKey` action in the user's `bindings.json` file.

# Bindable actions and bindable keys

#Final notes
Note: On some old terminal emulators and on Windows machines, `CtrlH` should be used
for backspace.

Additionally, alt keys can be bound by using `Alt-key`. For example `Alt-a`
or `Alt-Up`. Micro supports an optional `-` between modifiers like `Alt` and `Ctrl`
so `Alt-a` could be rewritten as `Alta` (case matters for alt bindings). This is
why in the default keybindings you can see `AltShiftLeft` instead of `Alt-ShiftLeft` 
(they are equivalent).
