# Tutorial

This is a brief intro to `micro` workflow with simple examples how to configure
settings, keys, and use `init.lua`.

Hopefully you'll find this useful.

## Command mode

Press `Ctrl-e` to open micro's command prompt. Typing `help tutorial` will open
this documentation.

For the rest of the docs `> help tutoral` indicates pressing `Ctrl-e`.

## Default keyboard shortcuts

Enter `> help defaultkeys` for a list of the default keybindings.

## Simple workflow: Move content from one file to another

For this example, we edit micro's own codebase, and move contents between files.

Press `Ctrl-o` and enter filename to open the file in the current view
(use `Tab` key to help with autocompletion)
```
> open internal/config/plugin_manager.go
```
Then from the command prompt (`Ctrl-e`) open a second file in a vertical split
```
> vsplit internal/config/plugin.go
```
Use `Ctrl-w` ("jump to next split" shortcut) to switch to the first file and
cut the `PluginInfo` structure into clipboard using `Ctrl-x`.

Press `Ctrl-w` again to switch back to second file and paste the clipboard
content using `Ctrl-v`.

Now press `F2` to save current file and `Ctrl-q` to close it.

To preview the changes, run `git diff` by pressing `Ctrl-b` ("shell mode")
and entering the command. You will see changes only to the second file
`plugin.go`, because the first file is not saved yet.

Hit `Ctrl-q` again and micro will prompt if you want to save the first file
before closing. Press `y` and you're done.

Congratulations with completing your first mouseless tutorial with micro.

## Settings

In micro, your settings are stored in `~/.config/micro/settings.json`, a file
that is created the first time you run micro. You can edit the `settings.json`
file directly, or you can use `> set option value` command from micro, which
modifies `settings.json` file too, so that the setting will stick even after
you close micro.

You can also set options temporary for the local buffer without saving then.
For example, if you have two splits open, and you type `> setlocal tabsize 2`,
the tabsize will only be 2 in the current buffer, and micro will not save
this local change to the `settings.json` file.

You can also set options for specific file types in `settings.json`. If you
want the `tabsize` to be 2 only in Ruby files, and 4 otherwise:

```json
{
    "*.rb": {
        "tabsize": 2
    },
    "tabsize": 4
}
```

Micro will set the `tabsize` to 2 only in files which match the glob `*.rb`.

See `> help options` to read about all the available options.

### Setting keybindings

Keybindings work in much the same way as options. You configure them using the
`~/.config/micro/bindings.json` file.

For example if you would like to bind `Ctrl-r` to redo you could put the
following in `bindings.json`:

```json
{
    "Ctrl-r": "Redo"
}
```

Very simple.

You can also bind keys while in micro by using the `> bind key action` command,
but the bindings you make with the command won't be saved to the
`bindings.json` file.

For more information about keybindings, like which keys can be bound, and what
actions are available, see the `keybindings` help topic (`> help keybindings`).

### Configuration with Lua

If you need more power than the json files provide, you can use the `init.lua`
file. Create it in `~/.config/micro`. This file is a lua file that is run when
micro starts and is essentially a one-file plugin. The plugin name is
`initlua`.

This example will show you how to use the `init.lua` file by creating a binding
to `Ctrl-r` which will execute the bash command `go run` on the current file,
given that the current file is a Go file.

You can do that by putting the following in `init.lua`:

```lua
local config = import("micro/config")
local shell = import("micro/shell")

function init()
    -- true means overwrite any existing binding to Ctrl-r
    -- this will modify the bindings.json file
    config.TryBindKey("Ctrl-r", "lua:initlua.gorun", true)
end

function gorun(bp)
    local buf = bp.Buf
    if buf:FileType() == "go" then
        -- the true means run in the foreground
        -- the false means send output to stdout (instead of returning it)
        shell.RunInteractiveShell("go run " .. buf.Path, true, false)
    end
end
```

Alternatively, you could get rid of the `TryBindKey` line, and put this line in
the `bindings.json` file:

```json
{
    "Ctrl-r": "lua:initlua.gorun"
}
```

For more information about plugins and the lua system that micro uses, see the
`plugins` help topic (`> help plugins`).
