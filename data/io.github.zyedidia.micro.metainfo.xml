	<summary>A modern and intuitive terminal-based text editor</summary>
	<description>
		<p>
				Amicro is a terminal-based text editor that aims to be easy to use and
				intuitive, while also taking advantage of the capabilities of modern terminals.
				It comes as a single, batteries-included, static binary with no dependencies;
				you can download and use it right now!
		</p>
		<p>
			As its name indicates, micro aims to be somewhat of a successor to the nano
			editor by being easy to install and use. It strives to be enjoyable as a full-
			time editor for people who prefer to work in a terminal, or those who regularly
			edit files over SSH.
